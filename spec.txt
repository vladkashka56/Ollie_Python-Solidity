This job is for a one off project, although I hope that if work is done to a high standard we will be able to collaborate in future too.

I have a Python library that uses various mathematical functions to generate a set of coordinates given a single input. The Python dependencies are not ridiculously advanced libraries, so they should be possible to reproduce. We also don't need to reproduce every single part of the library.

If you have a mathematical or astronomical background, that would be a significant help.

Deliverables:
1. Well documented code
2. Demonstration that the Solidity code output is identical to the output of the Python library
3. Support, if required, putting the code live on the blockchain

The Python library is under 500 lines long and is readable. I can ask the developer of the Python library any questions necessary. You are welcome to put a placeholder bid prior to seeing the code, then updating your quote after I send you the code to review.

I look forward to working with you.

That's great smile 

We should have 2 methods at first:

Both accept a timestamp and observation point (planet)

One should return a list of 2D coordinates for the other planets, including their names

The other should return a list of 3D coordinates for the other planets

Later, we might want to add a start and end timestamp and - but that can be a future version.

I also have an improved version that can also plot 'Moons' positions, but we can add that later smile
